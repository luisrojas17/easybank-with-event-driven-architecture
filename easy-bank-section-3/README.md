# Easy Bank Section 3

All of these Microservices were developed by Spring Boot Framework and implementing next patters:

1. Service Registration and Discovery
2. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
3. Event Source


# Dependencies
All of these Microservices are based on:

1. Axon.
    https://www.axoniq.io/
2. H2 Database
    https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html


# Axon 

Axon is composed by three main components which are:

1. Axon Framework is a framework that provides a set of tools for building event-driven microservices.
2. Axon Server is a server that stores and processes events from Axon Framework.
3. AxonIQ Console is a web-based tool that provides a user-friendly interface for managing Axon Framework and Axon.


## Axon Server Setup Locally Using Docker

Axon Server provides an easy-to-use event store and messaging platform that is tailored for event-driven microservice
architectures using Axon Framework. Follow these steps to set up Axon Server on your local machine using Docker.

## Steps for Local Setup by Docker

This setup allows you to run Axon Server locally while ensuring that all important data (like events and configurations)
persist even if the container is stopped or removed. Each volume maps specific local directories to the container,
ensuring that Axon Server has access to the necessary configuration, data, and events on your system.

Note: Make sure create all subfolder inside your user directory.

### 1. Create the Axon Server Folder Structure

**Create a Folder Named `axonserver`:**  

   On your Desktop (or any preferred location), create a new folder named **axonserver**. This   will be used to store
   Axon Server configuration, data, and events.

**Subfolders:**

   - Inside the `axonserver` folder, create the following subfolders:
     - `config`: This folder will store the configuration file for Axon Server.
     - `data`: This folder will be used by Axon Server to store its internal data.
     - `events`: This folder will store the events processed by the server.

### 2. Configure Axon Server

In the `config` folder, create a file named **axonserver.properties**. This file will contain configuration settings 
for the Axon Server. Add the following properties inside the file:

```
server.port=8024
axoniq.axonserver.name=EazyBank Axon Server
axoniq.axonserver.hostname=localhost
axoniq.axonserver.devmode.enabled=true
```

- `server.port`: Specifies the port on which the Axon Server will be accessible. In this case, it's set to `8024`.
- `axoniq.axonserver.name`: Assigns a name to the Axon Server instance. Here itâ€™s set as "EazyBank Axon Server".
- `axoniq.axonserver.hostname`: Defines the hostname, which is set to `localhost` for local development.
- `axoniq.axonserver.devmode.enabled`: When enabled (`true`), this mode optimizes the server for local development purposes.

### 3. Run the Axon Server Docker Container

Now that the configuration is ready, you can start the Axon Server in Docker. Run the following Docker command in your terminal:

```bash
docker run -d --name axonserver \
    -p 8024:8024 -p 8124:8124 \
    -v "/home/luisrojas17/axonserver/data":/axonserver/data \
    -v "/home/luisrojas17/axonserver/events":/axonserver/events \
    -v "/home/luisrojas17/axonserver/config":/axonserver/config \
    axoniq/axonserver
```

**Explanation of the Docker Command**

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `--name axonserver`: Gives the container a name (`axonserver`), making it easier to manage.
- `-p 8024:8024 -p 8124:8124`: Maps Axon Server's internal ports (`8024` and `8124`) to the corresponding ports on your local machine. 
  - Port `8024` is used for the HTTP interface (Axon Dashboard).
  - Port `8124` is used for the gRPC interface that Axon Framework applications use to communicate with the server.
- `-v "/Users/eazybytes/Desktop/axonserver/data":/axonserver/data`: Mounts the local `data` folder to the container's `/axonserver/data` directory to persist Axon Server's internal data.
- `-v "/Users/eazybytes/Desktop/axonserver/events":/axonserver/events`: Mounts the local `events` folder to store Axon events.
- `-v "/Users/eazybytes/Desktop/axonserver/config":/axonserver/config`: Mounts the local `config` folder, where you placed the `axonserver.properties` file, to the container's `/axonserver/config` directory. This ensures that the server uses the custom configuration defined in this file.

### 4. Verify the Setup

Once the container is running, you can verify the Axon Server by visiting [http://localhost:8024](http://localhost:8024) in your browser.
This should open the Axon Server dashboard.

In this section you can make queries in order to find the aggregate identifier of each microservice.

# H2 Database
Also, all of these microservices used H2 Database which creating the database in user directory since the database 
is based on file. On the other hand, to explore the content's database you could access by next URL:

    http://{HOST}:{PORT}/h2-console/

For example:

1. Accounts
    http://localhost:8081/h2-console/
2. Cards
    http://localhost:8082/h2-console/
3. Loans
    http://localhost:8083/h2-console/
4. Customer
    http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
5. Gateway
    http://localhost:8072/h2-console/
6. Eureka
    http://localhost:8070/h2-console/ 


# Order to start each Microservice
You have to start each microservice according to next order:

1. Eureka Server
2. Gateway Server
3. Customer
4. Accounts
5. Cards
6. Loans
